## About me

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLouvain (ICTEAM), specializing in cybersecurity for communication systems.  
My research focuses on attack tree representations to model, analyze, and mitigate security threats in communication signal domains.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science (Cybersecurity & Networks) and have experience in teaching support at UCLouvain.
